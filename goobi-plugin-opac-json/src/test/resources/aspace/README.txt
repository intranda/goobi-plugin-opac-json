ASpace Files Information

I included 2 types of records: one is a resource record (top level collection) and the rest are archival object records. I'm including a little explainer about what you're seeing here.

1575.json is a resource level record, using the GET resource API call for this resource: https://archives.yale.edu/repositories/11/resources/1575.

The rest of the records are Archival Objects, which I got using the GET Archival Object API call.
